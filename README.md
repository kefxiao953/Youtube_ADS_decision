# Youtube_ADS_decision

## Tasks for Decision Making:

- Which videos should be streamed: 
- Analyze the performance of different types of videos on platforms like YouTube to determine which ones attract the most likes, comments, and views. These metrics suggest higher visibility and engagement.
- When to stream the videos: Identify the optimal times for streaming by analyzing viewer activity patterns. This includes determining the peak hours when potential customers are most active.
- Preparations for upcoming sales growth: Based on projected video performance and engagement, prepare for increased demand by scaling up necessary resources such as server capacity and customer support.

## Assessment of sales after the campaign: Evaluate the company's sales post-ad campaign to determine if the desired effects were achieved.

- Collect and preprocess data: Gather relevant data from sources like YouTube analytics.
- Decide on your data analysis strategy: Based on the collected data, form a strategy that will guide your analysis.
- Modeling based on analysis strategy: Use statistical or machine learning models to predict and analyze data.
- Create a presentation from analysis conclusions: Prepare a PowerPoint presentation to showcase key findings, including charts and graphs.

## Present the results of the data analysis.

- Conduct an A/B test to validate the effectiveness of the ad campaign.
- MLE Plus (for Machine Learning Engineering): Given that videos with more likes and comments tend to be more visible, the project manager suggests boosting the performance of company ads by automatically adding comments below videos containing the ads. However, manually commenting is time-intensive, so the use of machine learning to automatically generate and post relevant comments is proposed.

## Steps for MLE Goal:

- Collect and process textual comment data.
- Choose an appropriate machine learning model.
- Train the model.
- Deploy the model.
- Implement the model's API to automatically add comments.

### Overall Project: This project is designed to address a real-world internet business decision problem, using real YouTube video site data. The workflow will involve data cleaning, analysis, modeling, prediction, and finally making business decisions based on the data. The decision-making results will be validated using hold-out data.
